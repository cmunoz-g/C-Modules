# ðŸ“š CPP Modules

## Introduction
Welcome to the **CPP Modules** repository! This project is part of the 42 School curriculum and serves as an introduction to the C++ programming language. The goal of these modules is to familiarize you with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using C++, derived from your old friend C.

## Project Overview
This repository contains 10 modules, each focusing on different aspects of C++ and consisting of exercises that progressively increase in complexity.:

- **CPP00**: Basics of C++ syntax, namespaces, classes, and OOP introduction.
- **CPP01**: Memory allocation, pointers, references, and basic OOP.
- **CPP02**: Operator overloading and Orthodox Canonical Form.
- **CPP03**: Deeper dive into inheritance, polymorphism, and abstract classes.
- **CPP04**: Subtype polymorphism and abstract classes.
- **CPP05**: Error handling with exceptions.
- **CPP06**: C++ type casting and serialization.
- **CPP07**: Function and class templates.
- **CPP08**: Templated containers, iterators, and algorithms.
- **CPP09**: File I/O, serialization, and working with external resources.

## How to Use This Repository
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/cmunoz-g/CPP-Modules.git
    ```
2. **Navigate to a Module**: 
   ```bash
   cd CPP-Modules/CPP0X
    ```
Replace `CPP0X` with the module number you want to explore.

3. **Compile and Run**:

   Each exercise comes with a `Makefile`. Simply run:
   ```bash
   make
   ```
   Execute the compiled binary:
    ```bash
    ./program_name
     ```
## Learning Path
If you want to give it a go, feel free to start from any module and explore C++.
The exercises in this project follow a gradual learning curve. Start from CPP00 and progress sequentially.
